//Cite 3 Simple (Easy Problems on Sorting) Sorting Algorithms (JavaScript Based), and (a) Provide a brief description and (b) Sample Code of Application (with comments).

In the study of sorting algorithms, it is important to understand the simple ways of fixing the elements on a list. Here are three simple sorting algorithms that can be used in JavaScript:

1.Bubble sort - this is a simple and intangible sorting algorithm where the elements are repeatedly replaced by their similar elements until the list is properly fixed.

Sample Code:
"" JavaScript
Function Bubblesort (arr) {
Let n = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i <n-1; i ++) {
for (let j = 0; j <n-i-1; j ++) {
if (arr [j]> arr [j + 1]) {
Let temp = arr [j];
arr [j] = arr [J + 1] [J + 1] = temp; 
  }
 }
}
return arr;
}
'''

2.Selection sort - this is a sorting algorithm that converts elements by finding the smallest element in the list and transferring it to the first position.

Sample Code:
```javascript
function selectionSort(arr) {
let n = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
let minIndex = i;
for (let j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
minIndex = j;
 }
}
let temp = arr[i];
arr[i] = arr[minIndex];
arr[minIndex] = temp;
}
return arr;
}
'''

3.Insertion sort - this is a sorting algorithm that places each element in the correct position in the list by comparing the elements to its left.

Sample Code:
"" JavaScript
Function insertionsort (ARR) {
Let n = arr.length; for (zti = 1; i <n; i ++)
Let key = arr [i]; Let j = I - 1; while (j> = 0 && arr [j]> key) {arr [j + 1] = arr [j] j = j-1;
}
arr [J+1] = key;
 } return arr;
}
'''

Through these simple sorting algorithms, we can properly and properly organize the elements on a list by JavaScript. Understanding them will help us to accelerate and accelerate data on our projects.

//Cite 2 Intermediate (Medium Problems on Sorting) Sorting Algorithms (JavaScript Based), and (a) Provide a brief description and (b) Sample Code of Application (with comments).

There are two intermediate sorting algorithms in JavaScript that can be used for fixing medium-sized sorting problems. The first is the Merge Sort, a divide and conquer algorithm that provides a quick arrangement of the lists. The second is the Quick Sort, a recursive algorithm that provides a quick fix by dividing the list into smaller parts. 

For Merge Sort, the sample code

'''javascript
function mergeSort(arr){
if (arr.length<=1){
return arr;
}

const middle=
math.floor(arr.length/2);
const left= arr.slice(0, middle);
const right= arr.slice(middle);

return merge(
mergeSort(left)
mergeSort(right)
);
}

function merge(left, right){
let result=[];
let leftIndex=0;
let rightIndex=0;

while(leftIndex<left,right &&
rightIndex<right,length){
if (left[leftIndex]<
right[rightIndex]{
result.push(left[leftIndex]);
leftIndex++;
{else}
result.push(right.slice(right[rightIndex]);
rightIndex++;
 }
}

return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(rightIndex));
}
,,,

For Quick Sort, The sample code

'''javascript
function quickSort(arr){
if (arr.length<=1){
return arr;
}

const pivot=arr[arr.length - 1];
const left = [];
const right = [];

for(let i = 0; 1; i++){
if (arr[i]<pivot){
left.push(arr[i]);
{else}
right.push(arr[i]);
 }
}

return[...quickSort(Left);
pivot,...quickSort(right)];
}
'''
By using these sorting algorithms, we can quickly solve medium- sized sorting problems through Javascript.

//Cite 1 Complex (Hard Problems on Sorting) Sorting Algorithms (JavaScript Based), and (a) Provide a brief description and (b) Sample Code of Application (with comments).

In the field of computer science, sorting algorithms are important concepts used to properly adjust the elements of a list or array in a particular order. 
There are different types of sorting algorithms with its own capabilities and weaknesses depending on the size of the dataset and other factors.

One of the most complex sorting algorithms is the Quick Sort. 
The Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm working by dividing the dataset through a pivot element and separate it into two sub-arrays smaller dataset. 
Each sub-array will then sort using the same process until the whole dataset becomes sorted.

Here's an instance of Quick Sort Algorithm in JavaScript:

'''javascript
//function to partition the array and return the index of the pivot element function pertition (arr,low,high){
let pivot = arr [high];
let i = low - 1;

for(let j= low;j< high;j++){
if (arr[j]<pivot){
i++;
[arr[i], arr[j]]= arr[j]],arr[i]];
 }
}

[arr[i+1], arr[high]] = [arr[high],arr[i+1;
}

//function to implement Quick Sort algorithm
function quickSort(arr,low,high){
if(low <high){
let pi = partition (arr,low, high);

quickSort(arr,low,pi - 1);
quickSort(arr,pi + 1, high);
 }
}

//sample usage
let arr = 10,7,8,9,1,5,];
let n = arr,length;

quickSort(arr,0, n - 1);
console.log("Sorted array:", arr);
'''

with the Quick Sort Algorthm, we can properly adjust the elements of a list in a quick and efficient way. this is an important tool in programming and computer science that will help us solve complex sorting problems.
